| <a name="answer-1">1</a> | React is an *open sorce* *js library*, developed by facebook(meta). It is used to build *UI interfaces* & simplifies creation of *SPA(Single Page Applications)*, using *reusable components* & *dynamic rendering*. It follows *Component based architecture*.  |
| <a name="answer-2">2</a> | Single Page Application has only one web page. Whenever data is updated by user, it gets *dynamically rendered* on page without a *full reload*. <br/> eg: When a page is switched via Navbar section on an app developed by react, page changes without reloading the page. here, `<Link>` doesnt reloads page while `<a>` does. |
| <a name="answer-3">3</a> |  1. High Performance: React uses Virtual Dom which ensures only part of webpage where data changes gets updated instead of entire page, leading to faster & smoother app. <br/> 2. One way Data Binding: Data flow in React is unidirectional, it flows from Parent to Child. This makes app predictable & easy to debug. <br/> 3. JSX (js XML): React used js syntax extension which makes code HTML like, thus writing HTML in js, making code more UI friendly & readable. <br/> 4. Component Based Architecture: React uses reusable, independent components for rendering UI & logic, making code resuable & modular. <br/> 5. Server Side Rendering Support: react supports server-side rendering components thus improving performance & SEO optimisation for the web apps. <br/> 6. Dedicated Developer Tools: Chrome has specialised Developer Tools which help in simplifying debugging & performance monitoring.
